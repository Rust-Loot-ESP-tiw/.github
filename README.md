## 👁️ What Is Rust Loot ESP?

**Rust Loot ESP** is a cheat feature that overlays all loot-related objects on your screen in real time. It works by scanning entity positions and names, then displaying boxes, items, resources, and even buried stashes through walls, terrain, or darkness.

It’s fully customizable, lightweight, and can be paired with **player ESP**, **aimbots**, or **auto-farm hacks** for complete map control.
